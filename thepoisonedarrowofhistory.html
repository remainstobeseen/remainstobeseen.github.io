<h3>&ensp;Cowboys and Indians</h3>
	<p>
	    America's noble story began with the mass rape and genocide of two whole continents worth of human beings. American fascists, especially every Officer and Archon with their fingers on meaningful levers of power, are fully aware of the reality and inevitable consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Namely, that when ecological catstrophe does come, there will only be two possible paths for the imperial core; massive redistribution of the ill-gotten plunder of the first world, or genocide. As the conditions in which borders were porous to capital and closed to movement of labor collapses, the fascist project has had to focus on soothing the people's conscience, smoothing over whatever intellectual and emotional grooves remain in the already-sandblasted, Antichristian heart of the American populace that might disrupt the feeling that the mass immiseration and murder of innumerable strangers is preferable to even the smallest personal sacrifice. The frontier machinery that carried the rabid American across the continent ran up against the Pacific, and was forced to turn elsewhere for it's human fuel, for new Indians. Now it not only sucks the marrow from our subject nations, but from the very people it nominally exists to enrich, but to do so has to wage a war of psychic numbing and consumerist overwhelm in order to maintain the American's delusion that he is and always will be a Cowboy, one of God's protected elect, and certainly not one of the vile, backwards Lamanites who the machine has rightly constrained to various sorts of cramped Skinner boxes until the Final Solution's engine finishes warming up.

<h3>&ensp;The Black Iron Prison</h3>
	<p>
		"[D]uring the interval in which he had experienced the two-world superimposition, he had seen not only California, USA, of the year 1974 but also ancient Rome, he had discerned within the superimposition a Gestalt shared by both space-time continua, their common element: a Black Iron Prison. This is what the dream referred to as “the Empire.” He knew it because, upon seeing the Black Iron Prison, he had recognized it. Everyone dwelt in it without realizing it. The Black Iron Prison was their world." - Philip K. Dick, <i>VALIS</i>

<h3>&ensp;The Blind Harrow</h3>
	<p>
		JUDAEA, Jerusalem — 22 CE — Eighteen people have died and dozens have been injured after the sudden collapse of the Tower of Siloam earlier this morning. Several witnesses claim that the cracks in the tower's foundation had been visibly growing, and one local mason claimed to have been submitting complaint documents to the Roman Board of Infrastructure, but that he never recieved a response. When reached for comment, the office of Pontious Pilate stated that Roman bricks "remain a safe and legal, tried and tested product" and that the quality of the bricks was "immaterial to the question" of the tower's failure. "Those who perished in this tragic and unavoidable accident will not have perished in vain. The Roman office intends to perform a thorough investigation in order to determine which great sin of the Judaeans caused such a wrathful punishment from the divine."

<h3>&ensp;Science Camp</h3>
	<p> 
		While the United States can always claim to be the foremost innovator in the unethical human experimentation, the Third Reich has been one of the few entities to actually edge us out for a time. Once the war had been settled, though, the CIA reclaimed the belt from the Germans and continued their proud quest for the answers to such fundamental scientific questions as: "Can you give a guy so much meth that he astral projects into Castro's bedroom?", "What happens if you dump a bunch of boat cleaner in a city water supply?", and "Can women really feel pain, or are they just big fakers?". The US had it's justification, of course; our boys didn't have perfectly accurate numbers on how many people the Ruskies were experimenting on, and didn't want to mistakenly lowball it and abide the development of a 'Nuremburg gap'.<br><br>
<h3>&ensp;The Bomb or: Manmade is the Sword That Guards Eden</h3>
	<p>
		The Battle of Armageddon, concieved as the final conflict between Christianity as an expression of our collective union and Christianity as the Satanic worship of the self, began around 1789 and it's offical end (the 1992 armistice) was inevitable by 1945 once the Yankee acquires the nuke. Of course, the war continued to be fought after most of the shooting was over, but the archons celebrated their victory by parading around the rest of the world, dominating and capitalizing every remaining cubic inch of human flesh in their neverending quest to turn the market into a new god.<br><br>
