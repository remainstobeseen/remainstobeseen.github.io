<p>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When I'm having trouble crystallizing my thoughts about a movie, I like to go see what all the millennials on Reddit are saying about it. I figure people who actively post on Reddit like this are basically representative of the plurality of the movie-going bell curve that includes all the people willing to think about a movie after (maybe even while) they watch it, but usually only in pretty narrow terms. The kind of people who seem to think that, or who have been conditioned to act as if, movies are basically small, objective selections from parallel universes. The frenzy bubbles up before the theater lights have even come back up as everyone takes out their phone to see what the prevailing "fan theories" are. I don't mean theories like the one about The Shining and the moon landing, where the theory is focused on constructing meaning from the real events of the movie's creation in order to try and understand something about the world. Rather, I mean theories that go out of their way to fundamentally ignore what a movie actually is and transmogrify any sort of substance for genuine reflection into grist for the mass manufacture of fan content speculating about how many Ant-Mans can dance on the head of a pin.<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As much as I'd love to do a detailed taxonomy of all the different genres of "theory" that people use to suck the life out of art (see Kafka's In the Penal Colony for an object lesson in the consequences of this kind of "interpreting," viz., obsessing over something's brilliance of design and construction in a way that blinds you to what the thing actually is, what it can do to you), I want to focus on one "theory" in particular concerning The Witch. In a thread on the r/horror board asking about what people thought of the film, user Dry_Mastodon7574 posted the following comment:<br>
<p class="narrow"style="color:red;">
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"If you look closely in the beginning, you'll see that there is a fungus on the crops. This is ergot. It's a hallucinogenic and many historians believe that people eating this fungus led to the witch panic. I love how this movie uses historical fact to tell this story. It's nearly a documentary."<br>
</p>
<p>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This comment succinctly captures the total stupid essence of what I mean when I say that this way of trying to understand movies robs them of anything worth thinking about. The power of The Witch, and the thrust of a lot of really good historical fiction like this, is not in its ability to show us what we already know we think about those people, but rather to show us what it was like to be those people, otherwise why not just make a historical documentary? But Dry_Mastodon7574 and their ilk are not really interested in what it was like to live in 17th century Puritan America or what the human interest in portraying that life in art would even be. It's as if the movie is really some kind of black comedy for people clever enough to know that witches and the Devil aren't actually freaking real, as if the audience is meant to roll their eyes along with the director, all in on the joke that these crazy, primitive Jesus Freaks stupidly ate a bunch of poison that made them go crazy, and that it was so crazy. All the fat is boiled out of what it means for witches and the Devil to be real when the entire phenomenon is reducible to an empirical explanation absent of meaningful social and material context. <br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While this sort of reaction to media is unique in its particular historical manifestation, it certainly isn't anything new in the post-Reformation world. Writing from the overwhelmingly Lutheran environs of 19th century Denmark, Kierkegaard ran up against the consequences attempting to approach the truth of the Bible in "objective" terms. As biblical scholarship developed in Europe after the Enlightenment, certain academic theologians began contending with scripture from a historical (linguistic, archaeological, etc.) angle. Source criticism and other investigations sought to "uncover" the truth(s) "behind" scripture as supported by empirical, historical evidence.<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In For Self-Examination, Kierkegaard admits that though there is certainly value in this kind of research, to believe that truly meaningful, life-affecting spiritual truth can be uncovered by way empirical investigation is to confuse two different sorts of things we call "truth." He cautions us against believing that truth is something latent, hiding beneath the linguistic and historic obscurities of the text, and that only readers who can unveil or otherwise become conscious of the "facts of the case," as it were, will be able to actually arrive at the real truth, and establish it as objectively the case. Far from making Christianity then the sole enterprise of a few select scholars able to penetrate into the scientific nature of the thing, Kierkegaard wrote that this kind of scientific hermeneutic was a way for people to become Christians "as cheaply as possible." One's Christianity in this condition has less to do with the way in which one's life and values are transformed than it does with one's ability to nominally abide disengaged, impersonal, and intellectual doctrines and propositions that have been robbed of their spiritual weight. <br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Kierkegaard stresses instead that for us to arrive at meaningful spiritual ("subjective") truth, we must not be content with lifeless knowledge of the objective facts in and surrounding the text, but attentive to our relationship with the text and what it does to us. His useful analogy is to a mirror. It would be really bizarre to ask someone looking into a mirror what they see, only for them to respond with something like "there is a rectangular construction, of such-and-such a height and such-and-such a width, which seems to be made of a combination of mostly metal and glass." This person would have entirely missed the actual use of the mirror, that is, to allow someone to see themselves from a different angle than they could without it. <br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Much like the doofus who hasn't figured out how to use a mirror, Dry_Mastodon7574 hasn't quite grasped how to use a movie like The Witch. You ask them what they thought of the movie and they attempt an explanation. They think that they are able to "solve" the movie by virtue of their keen powers of observation, as if Robert Eggers is sitting around with restless leg syndrome desperately refreshing Reddit in the hopes that some clever viewer picks up on the fact that the otherwise totally confusing, disconnected, and meaningless events of his film could all be explained by the Hidden Mickey he slipped into the crop death scene. They imagine that the screenplay is secretly color-coded based on which scenes are literally dreams and which ones are literally not. The usually not very subtle subtleties of intentional ambiguity are lost on these little scientists who think all the stuff in The Shining happened because of a gas leak in the Overlook, or that it's all Danny's dream, or some other explanation that dissolves any of the questions, tensions, or ideas that led someone to make the work of art in the first place, or why it captures our interest so effectively. Why bother contending with the themes of The Godfather movies when you could spend time developing a "theory" that the oranges in the Godfather "universe" emit a powerful pheromone that provokes Italians to violence? Better yet, why not just fall asleep to a YouTube video called "The Godfather Iceberg DEEP DIVE" and be done with it.<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I'm exaggerating a little, but the point is that seen this way, art becomes a sort lifeless puzzle box; a comforting thought favored by those readers who can't help but conclude that any poem without immediately apparent propositional or sentimental content nevertheless must have some verifiable, universal content that could be paraphrased and explained. In my undergrad English program, I got to talk to and read the work of a lot of young writers, many of whom were exclusively or primarily interested in writing in the fantasy and science fiction genres. I noticed that there tended to be two pretty distinct ways that these writers approached writing in these genres. The first approach, not at all uncommon to undergraduate fiction in general, was to strike upon an interesting image or two, and then construct a more or less coherent (but usually noncommittal and vague) short story around those images. The second was to write a story within a fictional world of the author's design, including constructed languages, fantasy cartography, and very detailed magic "systems," much of which was functionally irrelevant to the actual story. Critically, these systems are not usually included as addenda to the stories; they're a sort of (ideally symbiotic) reference that the author uses as ready-made context, much like a Dungeon's and Dragons campaign, but the rules exist solely for self-enforcement by the author, instead of as consistent framework for cooperative gaming.<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I can totally understand the worldbuilding impulse, even over and above the one to prose; in high school I got bored of The Two Towers about halfway through, finding myself more interested in the "lore," i.e., the "systems" of the world; I tried to learn Elvish, and eventually dropped that and got into making my own constructed languages, fantasy maps, et cetera. It's a lot of fun, and I got to learn some cool stuff about landmass formation and linguistics. What's strange to me, though, is the conviction that worldbuilding is a prerequisite to a good fantasy story, as if the author is responsible in some way for an internally consistent explanation of their world. I think a lot of the blame could fall on people like Brandon Sanderson, whose work I won't claim to have read, but whose novels are extremely popular with this crowd of writers. I don't find it surprising that Sanderson comes out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the most accomplished worldbuilders in Christian America. My point is that the sort of singular impulse to reconcile movies into easily digestible realisms as a mode of interpretation seems increasingly pervasive, morphing almost into something resembling a virtue, and is even turning writers into Kafka's penal colony Officer, so preoccupied with the elegance of mechanical details that they lose sight of the machine's purpose. <br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The important thing for Dry_Mastodon7574, the thing that makes the movie good, is its allegiance to historical fact, that the movie is "nearly a documentary." But it just isn't. Like, it isn't at all like a documentary in almost any way. From the very beginning of the movie, it is made clear that witches are very real, not because the movie is interested in what would freaking happen if freaking witches were real, but because to the subjects of the movie, witches are real. The Puritans lived in an enchanted world where the Devil is a real guy who walks around and talks to you. But the Reddit contingent would have you believe there is little gained in trying to understand the experience of such a world in its own terms. 2005's The Descent is a great movie. I've got no clue what the deal with the monsters are. The movie doesn't either, which is only to say that it never comes close to attempting to explain the origin of the creatures, and why would it? I'm not saying there's no fun in a little idle speculation when we encounter the unexplained, that's the marrow of interpretation, but it's end should be reflection on what the movie can say rather than how its content can be most realistically and coherently justified. It's terrifying and baffling. I was terrified and baffled. Whether or not The Descent can say something about, for example, the social history of Appalachia is not contingent on how many clues I can find in the background that imply the monsters are actually just a bunch of degenerated Scots-Irish. What's so frustrating is that the explanation is (unnecessarily) also the terminus of the thought. It was actually just ergot. Maybe there's something to say about the sympathy between the enchanted, dislocating world of the Puritans and the enchanted, dislocating world of drug-induced hallucination, but whatever the movie can say about it can't be sufficiently paraphrased in terms of "figuring something out".<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When I refer to the "realism" in this approach, I mean only in form; for my purposes there isn't a significant distinction between earnestly explaining The Witch as the results of ergot poisoning and earnestly explaining that everything that happened in Get Out was just his paranoid friend's dream. Yeah, man. How cool would that be.
