	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Preemptively, I'd like to note that I think this movie has had a great associative disservice done to it by the overflowing trough of product-origins movies of the last decade that for better or worse eventually reached its vile terminus in <s>Mammon's</s> Jerry Seinfeld's paean to misanthropy, <i>Unfrosted</i>. This movie is actually interested in something, and has at least a little bit of trust in and respect for its audience (I'm still not clear on whether or not that Blackberry movie was produced in earnest (as much as these things can be) or just a cruel jab at the appearences of the real life mentally ill business guys it appears to portray). <i>The Founder</i> is, I think, a pretty well-crafted portrait of the midcentury American psyche.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As Matt Christman has pointed out, much like a lump of coal compressed into something resembling a jewell, Kroc is the perfected aggrieved Nixonian subject. To come away from this with only a resentment for Kroc as a sort of particular or abstract cruelty contra the cute burger brothers is to miss the point, I think, ) The McDonalds brothers don't have a different quality of moral fiber or virtue or character as such that differentiates them from Ray, they have an <i>aesthetic conviction</i> (and that only barely), which prevents them from getting to drive this big dope machine that they spent all this time carefully crafting, one that could only ever be driven by someone without any scruples about that or any other sort of conviction outside of whatever feeds the man in the whip seat, the man who, like Kroc, can percieve the blindness of the machine.<br>&emsp;&emsp;His transformation is a religious one. This is not to say a holy one. Images of Nixon late into the night, slurring questions like<br>&emsp;&emsp;"Which weighs more, Henry, pound of flesh or pound of blood?"<br>&emsp;&emsp;"The pound of flesh, sir. Flesh weighs more than blood."<br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>[Nixon groans]</i><br>&emsp;&emsp;And that aesthetic vision, the dream that ended up being the brothers' critical vulnerability, comes soup to nuts from the same wholesaler that shipped them the parts for their own infernal capitalist device. Manufactured by America's Hollywood and fueled by the masochsitic ecstasy of primitive accumulation, Dick and Mac are the element of obsession and libidinal gravity that Kafka depicts in <i>In the Penal Colony</i>'s Officer character. Ultimately, though, unlike the Officer (and unlike Kroc), they have to remain in some sort of creative control (Nick Offerman conducting the choreographed kitchen from a ladder like a symphony) and are thus incapable of extending that ecstasy towards a true fusion with the machine, the dionysian destruction of self-distinction Alan lusts for in <i>Equus</i>. One's ability to acquire power is a factor of one's ability to erode the difference between what is good for onesself and what is good for it, or rather what <i>one does</i> and what <i>it does</i>. Morality has been sucked under the great mass of the machine, replaced by subtle differences in mechanical <i>taste</i>.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I'll leave to you to figure out which of the other <i>Penal Colony</i> characters best represents your relationship to the national psychic torture rack.<br><br>
