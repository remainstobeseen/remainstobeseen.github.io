	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A gear shift in terms of the Coens' usual delivery, and they pulled it off superbly. On several occains speaks directly to the audience but they've done such a good job reversing their usual (and great!) course of maintaining a gesture to and recognition of the audience that it doesn't feel like it's a movie talking to you. That's really Tommy Lee Jones there in front of you blaming kids with piercings for the salivating maw of evil that capitalism and calvinist psychosis has hung over each of us, constantly terrifying or forcing us away from any relationship with our vulnerability and mortality that isn't willful denial and/or panicked desperation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I watched this once with my dad and my mom's dad, and at the end of the movie my dad (who, regarding most movies, is just happy to be there) asked my granddad what he thought. He said he hadn't liked the ending. His favorite book is Lonesome Dove, which is also his favorite movie. I guess in Lonesome Dove a bunch of horrible and nasty stuff happens, people die arbitrarily because of horrors manmade and natural, etc., etc., and despite it all they get the cattle to the ranch and get paid and get ready to do it all over again next year (I have neither seen nor read Lonesome Dove, but imagine it's like a grislier <i>City Slickers</i> without Billy Crystal). In sum, lots of nasty, brutish, and short experiences of life, but all easily romantically glossed by the aging suburban male who is in some sense validated and justified in their lifestyles by consuming the reality presented these westerns.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I think the rub here for my granddad was that there wasn't anything that could be called an unalloyed heroism or virtue, no natural justice, no reconciliation of or with struggle, only the observation of pain. The violence that, even if it destroys what we are made to accept as a hero in the end, does not thereby justify, glorify, or raise into the halls of the saints the victims of the conclusive cold blooded murder of our man on the run. There was never a way things use to be before the kids started putting bones in their noses, the only difference is that since the frontier closed, the evil has been turned back on its own engine, has become rarified, omnipresent, and invisible. It grafts together with blood every high rise and every acre of grazing land in the country. No longer can the American self-assuredly point to and abitrarily declare something to be the doomed object of one's righteous, violent struggle. He can only gesture wildly and blindly in every direction, flinging salt over what's left of the earth as the very sound and fury that was once his claimed vigor and virtue consumes him in body, mind, and spirit alike.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There is no nihilistic vengeance, no self-immolation, no tragedy in the classical sense. There is nothing to inspire any kind of emotional bouyancy, particularly of the kind that many men of my granddad's generation erotically repress as a sort of pastime and way to engage with their peers. Notable that he loved <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, but probably because it delivers much of the same horror as the Coens have done here (and a far greater, more intractable horror, at that) without talking to you, without presenting the horror in it's localized or first-degree manifestation. It also has a lot of good jokes and Slim Pickins goes yahoooeeeyyy at the end which can all be pretty distracting for the average baby boomer, and they're liable to walk away grinning, rubbing their belly, satisfied that the world is, really, so very different from all of that. Those goofy Russians sure are goofy. I am grateful that the Coen brothers did not choose to include any goofy Russians in <i>No Country for Old Men</i>. <br><br>
